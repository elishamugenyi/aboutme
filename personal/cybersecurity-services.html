            <h1>Cybersecurity Solutions</h1>

            <p class="cybermsg">Cybersecurity has become increasingly important in recent years as cyber threats continue to evolve and become more sophisticated. Cybersecurity solutions are designed to help protect businesses from cyber threats such as malware, phishing attacks, and data breaches.
                Some of the cybersecurity solutions that businesses can take advantage of include:        
                Antivirus and anti-malware software: These types of software can help to protect a business's systems from viruses and malware that can compromise sensitive data.        
                Firewall protection: Firewalls can help to prevent unauthorized access to a business's network and systems.
                Data encryption.: Data encryption can help to protect sensitive data from being intercepted and read by unauthorized parties.
